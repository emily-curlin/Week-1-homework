Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?

1)	When looking at all countries combined, the number of crowdfunding campaigns for plays (whether successful, failed, or otherwise) far exceeds the number for all other categories.
2)	Campaigns appear to be most successful in June and July 
3)	For every successful campaign there are about equal numbers of failed/canceled campaigns in a given category.


What are some limitations of this dataset?

1)	The money raised for each campaign is not all from the same currency. This makes it difficult to make definitive comparisons between countries, categories, etc. 
2)	Some parent categories have very few subcategories, whereas others have many subcategories. Therefore, when comparing subcategories, some appear to have significantly less successful campaigns when compared to a less diluted category such as plays. 
3)	Some campaigns lasted longer than others, it may not necessarily be accurate to compare a month-long campaign to a day long campaign.

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?

1)	The amount of funding generated in each category and sub-category would help identify which categories generated the most revenue, regardless of the number of successful campaigns.
2)	A graph that illustrated the average donation per category would offer another way to compare categories/subcategories beyond number of successful campaigns. Just because a campaign is successful, does not mean it generated more money than another category.
3)	Generating a new data column that identified the length in days of a campaign and then using it in a pivot table to compare the success/failure of a campaign and amount raised per category would also be helpful.
4)	Use of staff pick and spotlight categories could be analyzed in a pivot table to illustrate if staff picks and spotlighting was associated with greater revenue or a higher success rate.
